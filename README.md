Reflective Writing on Data Types in C++
Write a short reflection (100-150 words) on how each basic data type in C++ (integers, floating-point numbers, characters, boolean, and strings) is used in programming. Consider:

 - Data types is a fundamentals of programing language as it allows it to control data on higher level instead of managing each piece of data as literals, it give programer a flexibility to create robust and easy code,with the basic data types you can do almost most task as its the base for other complex data type, we can use each data for its purpose, int for whole number and used for holding huge amount of precise value, floats are very small precise value used for data science, bool contain states true and false used for conditions, and string a array of characters used for holding data used for information like name

Role in Program Design:How do these data types guide the design and functionality of a C++ program?
Personal Alignment:

 - Data types help the programer to efficiently create effective code as it contributes on readability of the code,it helps on searching for errors and bug, on assembly we dont have data types as everything is a binary(int) and we have to write a program that will process information like name,numbers and floats. A efficient code must be able to debug quick and organized on way that other programer will be able to cooperate

Which data type do you find yourself using the most, and why does it align well with your programming needs or style?
 - Me coding in python and js i almost use all type of data but i think i used str and int the most as most of my project is data processing as it was the kind of data i was working with, it also allows me to have a control over the values and be able to process them with my will 

Example Usage:[here](https://github.com/hitoyaCute/brainoof-python-implementation-)

Provide an example of a C++ program or scenario where you effectively used one or more of these data types.
